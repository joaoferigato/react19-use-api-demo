# React 19 use API Examples

This repository contains simple examples of the `use` API introduced in React 19.

It demonstrates how `use` differs from React Hooks and how it can be used to read Promises and Contexts, especially when combined with Server Components and Suspense.

## What’s included

- Using `use` with Context
- Using `use` with Promises
- Streaming Promises from Server to Client Components
- Suspense-based loading states

## Requirements

- React 19
- Framework with Server Components support (e.g. Next.js App Router)
- Node.js 18+

## Running locally

`npm install`<br>
`npm run dev`
<p>Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.</p>

## Notes

This project is for learning purposes and uses artificial delays to simulate expensive operations.
